# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The WTWR back-end project focuses on building a server for the What to Wear? application. This project provides a foundation in setting up a database-driven server with a focus on security, error handling, and responsive API design. The server enables authenticated users to manage wardrobe items based on weather conditions.

# Project Overview

The WTWR server interacts with the front-end application, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items stored in a MongoDB database. This project includes user authentication, which protects specific routes to ensure only authorized users can perform certain actions.
